### Hello there!

Welcome to my profile!
My name is Lionel, and I'm a complete nerd. 

I am a data scientist and analyst - with a dash of data engineering skills, although my element lies in Machine Learning, statistics, and data validation. 
I have a keen interest in all things Computer Vision, IoT, Distributed Systems, and Deep Learning - and I'm always continuously woking to update and improve my skillsets. 


####  For recruiters / employers:
Hello! I'm glad you took the time to visit - I'm assuming you're here for the projects section? If so, feel free to have a look through the repo titled 'Code-Assignments-Projects'.
Navigate to the 'Projects' folder for all notable projects I've undertaken - both technical and research related so far.
